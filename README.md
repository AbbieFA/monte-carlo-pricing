# monte-carlo-pricing
Independent Monte Carlo pricing project for financial derivatives

Wrote this to take a break from all the pure math work at uni... A casual research project to further develop my finance and code modelling experience!

- The Overleaf PDF, 'Overleaf PDF for European Option Pricing.pdf' contains the theoretical background, model assumptions, and interpretation of results.
- The Jupyter Notebook, 'Monte Carlo European option pricing.ipynb' contains the full implementation, simulations, and plots.

The PDF paper follows the structure of the notebook and can be read independently.
